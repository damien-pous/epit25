    Course 1: Formalizing initial algebras and final coalgebras---towards the need for quotients
*)

(** * Preliminaries: Setoids

  Setoids emulate quotients that mathematicians routinely use.
  A setoid is the data of a Type paired with an equivalence relation.
  Morphisms between setoids are maps preserving this equivalence.

  We take the file [setoids.v] as a black box providing support to work with them (albeit feel free to open it!).
  The module provides us with:
  - A structure of [Setoid]
  - Notations for its equivalence: [eqv], written [‚â°] ("\equiv")
  - The notion of map between setoids: [X -eqv-> Y]
*)

(** * Part 1: Categories

    In this first course, we aim specifically at the formalization of initial algebras and final coalgebras. The shortest path therefore takes us through defining:
    - categories and functors
    - isomorphisms
    - inital/final objects
    - (co)algebras

*)

(** * 1. Categories

    We start by formalizing the bits of category theory we need to build up to initial algebras and final coalgebras.
    Importantly, notice that objects are captured as a Type, while the homset between two objects are a Setoid.
    Indeed, thinking of standard examples, arrows may be functions (we want to consider them extensionally),
    lambda termes (we want to consider them up-to Œ≤Œµ), etc...
    We package in the same structure both the data and the axioms.

(** We can already toy with the structure by defining a few categories.
   Note that [Program] allows you to only fill in explicitely the data in the definition of the structure.
   It will try to solve the properties automatically, and will provide them to you as obligations to solve interactively otherwise.

    - Warning: you may have to define your own setoid.
